## What is Derived State?

**Derived state** is a value calculated from one or more parts of your store â€” like computed properties in Vue or selectors in Redux Toolkit.

Example:
```ts
isAdult = age >= 18
fullName = firstName + " " + lastName
```

Zustand doesn't provide built-in computed values â€” you can derive inside or outside the store.

---

## Static vs Dynamic Computation

You can either:

- ðŸ“¦ Compute values **inside the store** and expose them
- ðŸ§  Or compute **outside** using selectors in the component

---

## Derived Inside the Store (Simpler)

```ts
type UserStore = {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  fullName: string;
  update: (firstName: string, lastName: string) => void;
};

const useUserStore = create<UserStore>((set) => ({
  firstName: "Jane",
  lastName: "Doe",
  fullName: "Jane Doe",
  update: (firstName, lastName) =>
    set(() => ({
      firstName,
      lastName,
      fullName: `${firstName} ${lastName}`,
    })),
}));
```

âœ… `fullName` is updated whenever `update()` is called.

---

## Derived Outside the Store (Preferred for Complex Logic)

```ts
const fullName = useUserStore((s) => `${s.firstName} ${s.lastName}`);
```

This keeps your store lean and your component reactive.

You can even wrap it:

```ts
const useFullName = () =>
  useUserStore((s) => `${s.firstName} ${s.lastName}`);
```

## When to Use Which?

| Strategy | Use When |
|----------|----------|
| Derived inside store | Small, static, tightly bound values |
| Derived outside store | Dynamic logic, expensive computations, better separation |

For complex state trees, itâ€™s better to derive in your UI layer.

---

## Summary

- Derived state is calculated from your storeâ€™s data
- You can derive it inside or outside the store
- For small use cases, do it inside; for complex ones, do it via selectors
- Zustand stays flexible and unopinionated â€” you're in control

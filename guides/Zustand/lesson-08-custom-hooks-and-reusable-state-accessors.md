## Why Use Custom Hooks with Zustand?

Zustand allows direct access to state anywhere, but **custom hooks** help you:

- Avoid repetition
- Apply consistent selectors
- Add memoization or derived logic
- Improve readability in components

---

## Creating Selective Accessors

Instead of repeating this:

```tsx
const bears = useBearStore((s) => s.bears);
const increase = useBearStore((s) => s.increase);
```

You can wrap it:

```ts
export const useBearCount = () => useBearStore((s) => s.bears);
export const useBearActions = () =>
  useBearStore((s) => ({ increase: s.increase, reset: s.reset }));
```

In components:

```tsx
const bears = useBearCount();
const { increase } = useBearActions();
```

---

## Composing Derived State in Hooks

You can also use derived values inside your custom hooks:

```ts
export const useFullName = () =>
  useUserStore((s) => `${s.firstName} ${s.lastName}`);
```

This keeps components lean and moves logic to reusable hooks.

---

## Naming and Organizing Hooks

üìÅ Recommended structure:

```
/stores
  useUserStore.ts
  useCounterStore.ts
/hooks
  useFullName.ts
  useIsAdult.ts
```

Use `useXyz` naming to stay idiomatic with React.

---

## When to Use vs When to Avoid

‚úÖ Use custom hooks when:

- You're repeating the same selectors/actions
- You need derived logic in multiple places

üö´ Avoid if:

- The logic is simple and used only once
- It would hide critical state flow

---

## Summary

- Custom hooks improve composability and reusability
- Extract selectors, actions, and derived state
- Keep components declarative and focused
- Great for shared logic, clean architecture, and testability

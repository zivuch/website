## Start with the Business Domain

Before you write code or design APIs, **understand the business**.

Let's say you're building an **e-commerce platform** or a **SaaS product**.

Ask:

- What are the major business capabilities?
- What problems does this platform solve?
- Who are the users?

Don’t start with tech — start with **value delivery**.

---

## Identify Core Services

Start breaking the business domain into high-level services.  
Example for e-commerce:

- `UserService` – registration, login, profiles
- `ProductService` – product catalog, search
- `OrderService` – checkout, order history
- `InventoryService` – stock levels, updates
- `PaymentService` – billing, refund
- `NotificationService` – email/SMS/push

Each service owns a **bounded context**.

---

## Define Service Boundaries

Ask:

- What does this service own?
- What data belongs to it?
- What is its source of truth?

✅ Services should:

- Have a clear single responsibility
- Not share databases
- Be deployable independently

Avoid "anemic" services like `AuthService` with only one method, or bloated services doing too much.

---

## Pick Communication Patterns

- Use **REST or gRPC** for direct service-to-service calls
- Use **events (Kafka, RabbitMQ)** for decoupled workflows
- Use **message queues** for background jobs (e.g. thumbnails)

Examples:

- `OrderService` calls `PaymentService` (sync)
- `OrderService` emits `OrderPlaced` event (async)
- `InventoryService` listens and reduces stock

---

## Design the Tech Stack

Choose tools and platforms based on your team and goals:

- **Languages**: Node.js, Go, Java, Python
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **Containers**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes or ECS
- **Messaging**: Kafka, NATS, or RabbitMQ
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, ArgoCD

Make sure your stack supports:

- Observability
- Scaling
- Security

---

## Draw the Initial Architecture

Sketch out the big picture.  
Example layout:

```
[Client]
   ↓
[API Gateway]
   ↓
 ┌────────────┬───────────────┬────────────┐
 │UserService │ProductService │OrderService│
 └────────────┴──────┬────────┴────────────┘
                     ↓
              [PaymentService]
                     ↓
              [NotificationService]
```

Use tools like:

- draw.io
- Whimsical
- Miro
- Excalidraw

Include DBs, message brokers, gateways, and external APIs.

---

## Summary

Start your microservice design by understanding the business.  
Identify meaningful services, define clear ownership, pick appropriate comms patterns, and sketch your architecture before writing code.

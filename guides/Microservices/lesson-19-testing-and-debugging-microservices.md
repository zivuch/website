## Types of Tests in Microservices

Each microservice should have its own **isolated test suite**, typically including:

- ✅ **Unit tests** – fast, local logic
- ✅ **Integration tests** – DB, APIs, external I/O
- ✅ **Contract tests** – ensure that service interfaces don’t break consumers
- ✅ **End-to-end tests** – simulate full workflows

Test each service in isolation **and** in context.

---

## Unit vs Integration vs Contract Tests

| Test Type        | Scope                | Example                                             |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Unit Test        | Function/module only | `validateEmail()`, `calcTotal()`                    |
| Integration Test | DB/API involved      | `POST /orders`, `GET /users`                        |
| Contract Test    | Interface definition | `user-service returns {id, email}` to order-service |
| E2E Test         | Full system          | User logs in and places order                       |

Use:

- `jest`, `mocha`, `vitest` for JS testing
- `supertest` for API integration tests
- `pact` or `contract-test` for consumer-driven contracts

---

## Mocking Dependencies

Mocking external calls makes tests:

- Isolated
- Faster
- Deterministic

Examples:

- Mock database with in-memory DB or libraries like `mongodb-memory-server`
- Mock API calls using `nock` or `msw`
- Stub Kafka/RabbitMQ with a test double or local dev queue

```ts
jest.mock("../services/emailService");
```

---

## Testing Inter-Service Communication

Test events and APIs using:

- **Consumer-Driven Contracts** (e.g., Pact)
- Shared Zod schemas or OpenAPI specs
- Replayable event fixtures (sample messages)

Tip: version your events and schemas for backward compatibility

---

## Debugging in a Distributed System

Distributed debugging can be tough. Here’s how to approach it:

✅ Use **correlation IDs** across requests  
✅ Use **structured logs** with `traceId`, `userId`  
✅ Enable **distributed tracing** (Jaeger, Zipkin, Datadog)  
✅ Visualize service dependencies (e.g., with OpenTelemetry)

### Pro Tip:

Add middleware to automatically attach trace context to every request.

---

## Summary

Testing and debugging in microservices requires a layered approach:

- Write unit and integration tests for each service
- Validate communication with contracts
- Use tracing and structured logs to debug across services

Invest in observability and testing up front — it pays off at scale.

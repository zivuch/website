## What Is a Service Mesh?

A **service mesh** is a dedicated infrastructure layer that handles **service-to-service communication**.  
It works without modifying your application code.

In a mesh, each service talks to a **sidecar proxy**, which manages:

- Routing
- Authentication
- Observability
- Retries and timeouts

---

## Why Use a Service Mesh?

Microservices bring flexibility—but they also introduce complexity:

- Debugging is harder
- Communication failures are silent
- Security between services is non-trivial

A service mesh solves these problems by offering:

- Uniform policies
- Metrics and tracing
- Encryption with **mTLS**
- Traffic shaping (canary, failover, etc.)

---

## Sidecar Proxy Pattern

Each service instance runs alongside a small proxy (like Envoy):

```
Service A ─┐
           ├─> Envoy Proxy ─> Network
           └<─ Envoy Proxy <─
```

All incoming/outgoing traffic is handled by the proxy.  
This allows:

- Zero changes to app code
- Full control of communication behavior

---

## Key Features of Service Meshes

✅ **Traffic Routing & Control**

- Weighted routing (canary deployments)
- Retries, timeouts, circuit breakers

✅ **Observability**

- Tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin)
- Metrics (Prometheus)
- Logging

✅ **Security**

- Automatic **mTLS** between services
- Policy enforcement
- Access control

✅ **Resilience**

- Retry, failover, connection pooling
- Rate limiting, bulkhead isolation

## Popular Service Mesh Tools

| Tool               | Highlights                                   |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Istio**          | Feature-rich, built on Envoy, widely used    |
| **Linkerd**        | Lightweight, simple, fast to adopt           |
| **Consul Connect** | Integrates with Consul for service discovery |
| **Kuma**           | Built by Kong, flexible with Kubernetes/VMs  |

All integrate well with Kubernetes.

## Do You Really Need One?

**Maybe not yet.**  
Start without a mesh unless:

- You have dozens of services in production
- You're struggling with observability and traffic control
- You need advanced routing, retries, or mTLS

Mesh = added complexity, added power. Don’t adopt prematurely.

---

## Summary

A **service mesh** like Istio or Linkerd provides visibility, control, and security across your services — without modifying app code. It's powerful, but should be introduced when your scale justifies it.

## What Are Microservices?

**Microservices** are an architectural style where an application is structured as a collection of **independent, loosely coupled services**, each responsible for a single business capability.

Each microservice:

- Runs in its own process
- Has its own database or state
- Communicates with other services over HTTP, gRPC, messaging queues, etc.
- Can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently

## Monolith vs Microservices

| Monolithic Architecture             | Microservices Architecture      |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Single unified codebase             | Multiple independent services   |
| Shared database                     | Decentralized data per service  |
| Tightly coupled functionality       | Loosely coupled services        |
| Simple to deploy initially          | Scales better long-term         |
| Harder to scale parts independently | Can scale individual services   |
| Higher blast radius for failures    | Isolation limits impact of bugs |

## Why Microservices? Key Benefits

✅ **Scalability** – Services can scale independently based on load  
✅ **Flexibility** – Teams can use different tech stacks for each service  
✅ **Faster Development** – Teams can build, test, and deploy in parallel  
✅ **Fault Isolation** – A single service failing won't bring down the whole system  
✅ **Continuous Deployment** – Easier to release small, frequent updates

## Real-World Examples

- **Netflix**: Over 1000 microservices powering streaming, billing, recommendations, etc.
- **Amazon**: Decoupled services for orders, inventory, shipping, etc.
- **Uber**: Modular services for ride requests, payments, mapping, etc.

> “If you’re building at scale, monoliths start to become a liability. Microservices bring modularity back.” – Common engineering wisdom

## Common Misconceptions

- ❌ Microservices = Always Better  
  ➤ Not true. They add complexity. Great for scaling, bad for early-stage MVPs.

- ❌ You must use Docker/Kubernetes  
  ➤ While helpful, they are not required. You can build microservices without containers.

- ❌ Microservices mean each function is a service  
  ➤ No. Services should own a **business capability**, not be split arbitrarily.

---

## Summary

Microservices break down large applications into small, manageable, and independently deployable services. They enable fast-paced development at scale, but require careful planning, infrastructure, and team coordination.

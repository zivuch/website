## Why CI/CD Matters More in Microservices

In a monolith, you deploy one thing.  
In microservices, you may deploy 5, 15, or 100+ independent services.

Without automation:
- Updates are slow and error-prone
- Testing is inconsistent
- Rollbacks are risky

**CI/CD pipelines make it safe and repeatable to build, test, and deploy services at scale.**

---

## CI/CD Pipeline Structure

For each service, a typical pipeline includes:

1. **Build**
   - Compile and package code
   - Create Docker image
2. **Test**
   - Run unit, integration, and contract tests
3. **Lint + Security**
   - ESLint, secret scans, dependency checks
4. **Tag & Push**
   - Push Docker image to registry
5. **Deploy**
   - Deploy to Kubernetes or another platform
6. **Notify**
   - Slack/email/report success/failure

Use one pipeline per service.  
Shared templates can reduce duplication.

---

## Versioning and Tagging Strategies

Use version tags to track builds:

- `user-service:1.4.2`
- `inventory-service:2024.05.01-abc123`

Avoid using only `:latest` unless you're building for dev environments.

Semantic Versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) works well for public APIs.  
Timestamp + Git SHA tags are helpful for internal-only services.

---

## Deployment Targets: Docker and Kubernetes

Most microservices run in:

### üê≥ Docker
- Standard packaging format
- Portable and easy to test locally

### ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes
- Schedule and scale containers
- Health checks, auto-scaling, rollouts
- Declarative YAML configs

Use `kubectl`, Helm, or GitOps tools (e.g. Argo CD) to manage deployment.

Example GitHub Action step:
```yaml
- name: Deploy to Kubernetes
  run: kubectl apply -f k8s/user-service.yaml
```

## Popular CI/CD Tools

| Tool            | Type              | Notes                        |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| **GitHub Actions** | Built-in CI/CD     | Great for open source, GitHub-native |
| **GitLab CI**    | Integrated w/ GitLab | Powerful and customizable     |
| **CircleCI**     | CI/CD platform     | Fast and efficient pipelines   |
| **Argo CD**      | GitOps deployment  | Declarative, Kubernetes-native |
| **Jenkins**      | Legacy but flexible| Requires more setup           |

üõ† Tip: Automate rollbacks and notifications to reduce incident response time.

---

## Summary

CI/CD is **essential** in microservice environments.  
Automate everything from testing to deployment. Use one pipeline per service and deploy frequently, safely, and consistently.

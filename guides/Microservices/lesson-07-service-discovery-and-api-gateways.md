## What Is Service Discovery?

In a microservice system, services often come and go dynamically (due to auto-scaling, deployments, or failures). Soâ€¦  
**how does Service A know how to reach Service B?**

**Service discovery** solves this by allowing services to register themselves and query other services dynamically.

---

## Static vs Dynamic Discovery

### ðŸ”¹ Static Discovery

- IPs or URLs are hardcoded
- Simple, but fragile and not scalable

### ðŸ”¹ Dynamic Discovery

- Services **register themselves** on startup
- Others **query** the registry to get healthy instances

Example:

```
Service A â†’ DNS / registry â†’ find Service B's IPs â†’ connect
```

---

## Using a Service Registry

A **service registry** keeps track of live service instances and their metadata (e.g., version, zone, port).

Popular tools:

- ðŸ”¸ **Consul** (by HashiCorp)
- ðŸ”¸ **Eureka** (by Netflix)
- ðŸ”¸ **Etcd** (used by Kubernetes)
- ðŸ”¸ **Zookeeper** (legacy systems)

Services register and deregister automatically.

---

## What Is an API Gateway?

An **API Gateway** sits in front of your services and:

- Routes traffic to the right service
- Enforces authentication and rate limits
- Performs logging, caching, and load balancing
- Can transform requests/responses (e.g., GraphQL â†’ REST)

Itâ€™s your **central access point**.

Example:

```
Client â†’ API Gateway â†’ routes to UserService or OrderService
```

## Popular Tools

| Tool        | Type                | Description                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Kong**    | API Gateway         | Plugin-based, high performance              |
| **Envoy**   | Proxy + Discovery   | Modern L7 proxy, built-in service discovery |
| **NGINX**   | Reverse Proxy       | Can serve as a simple gateway               |
| **Istio**   | Service Mesh        | Adds policy, security, routing, telemetry   |
| **Traefik** | Gateway + Discovery | Dynamic config with Docker/Kubernetes       |

Use gateways to centralize concerns â€” but avoid turning them into **monolith bottlenecks**.

---

## Summary

Microservices rely on **dynamic service discovery** to stay flexible and resilient. API gateways help manage traffic, security, and monitoring across all services. Together, they keep your distributed system connected and reliable.

## Failure Is Inevitable

In a microservice architecture:

- Networks are unreliable
- Services crash or restart
- Dependencies become temporarily unavailable

Instead of avoiding failure, **design for it**.

---

## Timeouts and Why They Matter

If Service A calls Service B with no timeout:

- A single hanging request could **exhaust threads**
- Latency piles up downstream
- Leads to **cascading failures**

### Set timeouts for:

- HTTP/gRPC calls
- DB queries
- Queue consumers

Example in Axios (JS):

```ts
axios.get("/users", { timeout: 3000 });
```

Tip: Start with conservative timeouts (2‚Äì5 seconds).

---

## Retries (and Backoff)

Some failures are transient (e.g., network blips, rate limits).  
A retry may succeed ‚Äî but too many retries can make things worse.

### Best Practices:

- Retry **only idempotent** operations (e.g., GET, PUT)
- Use **exponential backoff** with jitter
- Add a **retry cap** (e.g., 3 attempts)

Example:

```text
1st try ‚Üí wait 100ms
2nd try ‚Üí wait 400ms
3rd try ‚Üí give up
```

Use libraries:

- `axios-retry` (JS)
- `retry` (Node, Python)
- `resilience4j` (Java)

---

## Circuit Breaker Pattern

Circuit breakers prevent repeated failures from overloading systems.

It works like an electrical switch:

- Closed (normal traffic)
- Open (requests are rejected)
- Half-open (test to see if recovery occurred)

Use when:

- A service starts failing rapidly
- You want to fail fast and recover gracefully

Tools:

- `resilience4j`
- `Hystrix` (deprecated but famous)
- Service mesh (Istio, Linkerd)

---

## Fallback Strategies

When all else fails ‚Äî fallback.

‚úÖ Fallbacks return **cached**, **default**, or **stubbed** data instead of erroring out.

Examples:

- Return cached product catalog if DB is down
- Send user to retry page with a helpful message
- Queue request for retry instead of dropping it

> ‚ÄúA degraded user experience is better than none.‚Äù

---

## Summary

Failures are normal in distributed systems.  
Use **timeouts** to avoid waiting forever, **retries** for transient issues, **circuit breakers** to isolate faults, and **fallbacks** to protect the user.

## Key Takeaways

- ‚úÖ Microservices are about modularity, autonomy, and scale ‚Äî not complexity for its own sake.
- ‚úÖ Start with business domains, not technology.
- ‚úÖ Build for failure. Automate everything. Observe everything.
- ‚úÖ Good architecture grows incrementally.

You don‚Äôt need 15 services to ‚Äúdo microservices‚Äù ‚Äî just one decoupled, autonomous one.

---

## Best Practices Checklist

‚úÖ Own your data ‚Äî one DB per service  
‚úÖ Use versioned APIs or events ‚Äî no shared internal contracts  
‚úÖ Add retry + timeout logic to all network calls  
‚úÖ Secure internal traffic (mTLS, JWT, or service auth)  
‚úÖ Use structured logging and tracing everywhere  
‚úÖ Automate CI/CD with service-specific pipelines  
‚úÖ Prefer async messaging for decoupling  
‚úÖ Monitor, alert, and test continuously

---

## Common Anti-Patterns

‚ùå Starting with 20 services before validating the product  
‚ùå Sharing databases between services  
‚ùå Using the same deployment pipeline for every service  
‚ùå Ignoring observability or traceability  
‚ùå Rebuilding service discovery or orchestration from scratch  
‚ùå Writing too many ‚Äúthin‚Äù services ‚Äî high overhead, no value

## Use Case: Placing an Order

A typical e-commerce flow:
1. User places an order
2. Inventory is reduced
3. Payment is charged
4. Order is confirmed

We want to coordinate these actions **without tight coupling**.

---

## Choreography Pattern

Services communicate through **events only**.  
There’s **no central coordinator**.

### Example Flow:
```
OrderService → emits OrderCreated
InventoryService → reduces stock
PaymentService → listens and charges payment
NotificationService → listens and sends email
```

Each service:
- Reacts to events
- Emits new events
- Knows only **its part**

✅ Pros:
- Decoupled
- Scales well
- Easy to extend

❌ Cons:
- Harder to visualize flow
- Debugging chains of events is tricky

---

## Orchestration Pattern

A single service (the **orchestrator**) drives the workflow.

It tells other services what to do and waits for their response.

### Example Flow:
```
OrderService → starts saga
 → calls InventoryService
 → calls PaymentService
 → sends confirmation
```

This pattern:
- Gives **central visibility**
- Coordinates retry/fallback logic
- Works well for **Saga pattern** (with rollback steps)

✅ Pros:
- Clear workflow logic
- Central error handling

❌ Cons:
- Adds coupling
- Orchestrator can become a bottleneck

---

## Which Should You Use?

| Pattern        | When to Use                            |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Choreography** | Simple flows, highly decoupled domains |
| **Orchestration** | Complex logic, compensation needed     |

You can even **mix both** — orchestration for orders, and choreography for notifications.

---

## Implementing OrderService

In orchestration mode:
```ts
router.post('/order', async (req, res) => {
  const order = await Order.create({ userId, items, status: 'pending' });

  try {
    await callInventoryService(order);
    await callPaymentService(order);
    order.status = 'confirmed';
  } catch (err) {
    order.status = 'failed';
    // optional: emit OrderFailed event
  }

  await order.save();
  res.json(order);
});
```

In choreography mode:
```ts
router.post('/order', async (req, res) => {
  const order = await Order.create({ userId, items, status: 'pending' });
  publishEvent('order.created', { orderId: order._id, items });
  res.status(201).json(order);
});
```

---

## Implementing PaymentService

Subscribe to order events:
```ts
subscribeToEvent('order.created', async (data) => {
  const order = await getOrderDetails(data.orderId);
  const chargeResult = await chargeCard(order.userId, order.total);

  if (chargeResult.success) {
    publishEvent('payment.success', { orderId: order._id });
  } else {
    publishEvent('payment.failed', { orderId: order._id });
  }
});
```

---

## Summary

Use **choreography** to keep services autonomous and scalable.  
Use **orchestration** when flow coordination or compensation is complex.  
Understanding both is key to architecting resilient, maintainable systems.

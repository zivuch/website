## Synchronous vs Asynchronous Communication

There are two primary ways microservices can talk to each other:

**Synchronous (Sync)**  
- One service directly requests data from another
- Immediate response is expected
- Examples: `REST`, `gRPC`

**Asynchronous (Async)**  
- Services emit messages or events
- Receivers process them at their own pace
- Examples: `Kafka`, `RabbitMQ`, `AWS SNS/SQS`

ðŸ§  Think:
- Sync = **Phone call**
- Async = **Email**

## REST and gRPC

### REST (HTTP/JSON)
- Simple, readable
- Widely supported
- Slower due to JSON parsing and headers
- Great for public APIs

### gRPC (HTTP/2 + Protocol Buffers)
- Faster and smaller
- Strong typing via `.proto` files
- Requires code generation and tooling
- Ideal for internal microservice calls

ðŸ“Œ REST is often used for **external** APIs  
ðŸ“Œ gRPC is ideal for **internal** service-to-service calls at scale

## Event-Driven Architecture

In event-driven systems:
- A service **emits an event** (e.g. `UserCreated`)
- Other services **react** to that event if relevant

Benefits:
- Loose coupling
- Easy to add listeners without changing emitters
- Good for **audit logs**, **notifications**, **automation**, etc.

Example:
```
UserService -> emits UserCreated event
EmailService -> listens and sends welcome email
AnalyticsService -> listens and logs user metrics
```

## Using Message Queues

Message brokers help deliver messages reliably and decouple senders from receivers.

Popular choices:
- **RabbitMQ** â€“ push-based, queues
- **Kafka** â€“ high throughput, distributed log
- **NATS** â€“ lightweight and fast

Common patterns:
- **Publish/Subscribe** â€“ fire-and-forget events
- **Work Queue** â€“ background jobs (e.g. thumbnail generation)

Use cases:
- Billing
- Retry handling
- Data sync
- Email jobs

## When to Choose Which

| Pattern       | Use When...                                |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| REST          | Simplicity, public APIs, CRUD services      |
| gRPC          | Internal service-to-service, performance-critical |
| Events        | Decoupled workflows, side effects           |
| Queues        | Background tasks, retries, traffic spikes   |

ðŸ§© Mix patterns! Use REST for user-facing APIs and async for internal processing.

---

## Summary

Microservices use both **synchronous** (REST, gRPC) and **asynchronous** (events, queues) communication. Choose the right tool based on latency, reliability, and coupling requirements.

## Why Security in Microservices Is Hard

Monoliths usually have one access point (e.g. a web server).  
Microservices have many — and each service may:

- Receive public traffic
- Talk to other services
- Handle sensitive data

This means you must **protect every door**, not just the front gate.

---

## Authentication: Who Are You?

Authentication verifies the **identity** of the caller.

### External Users

Use standard protocols:

- **OAuth2 + OpenID Connect**
- **JWT tokens**
- Identity providers (Auth0, Keycloak, Okta)

Each request includes a bearer token:

```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
```

Services validate and extract user claims.

### Internal Services

For service-to-service identity:

- Use **service accounts**
- Or mutual TLS (more below)

---

## Authorization: What Can You Do?

Authorization controls **access to actions or resources**.

Common models:

- **RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control)
  - e.g., “admin” can access `/admin`
- **ABAC** (Attribute-Based Access Control)
  - e.g., allow based on department or request metadata
- **Scopes** (for APIs)
  - e.g., `read:orders`, `write:invoices`

Authorization logic can be:

- Built into each service
- Centralized using **OPA (Open Policy Agent)** or **AuthZ services**

---

## Securing Internal Communication with mTLS

**Mutual TLS (mTLS)** encrypts and authenticates traffic between services.

Features:

- Encrypts data in transit
- Verifies service identity
- Prevents spoofing or man-in-the-middle attacks

Tools that provide mTLS:

- **Istio**
- **Linkerd**
- **Consul Connect**
- **NGINX (with certs)**

✅ Let your service mesh manage mTLS automatically.

## Zero Trust and Defense in Depth

The modern approach = **Zero Trust**

> “Never trust, always verify.”

This means:

- Every request is authenticated and authorized
- Even if it's internal
- You assume the network is hostile

Apply **defense in depth**:

- Gateways validate user tokens
- Services validate internal service identity
- Fine-grained access rules
- Least privilege for service accounts

---

## Summary

Security in microservices must cover identity, access, and encryption — everywhere.  
Use modern protocols like OAuth2 and JWT for users, and mutual TLS for service communication. Don’t assume your internal network is safe.

## Typing Arrays

You can type arrays in two ways:

```ts
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
let fruits: Array<string> = ["apple", "banana"];
```

Both are valid. Choose whichever is more readable in your context.

---

## Readonly Arrays

To prevent mutation of an array:

```ts
const values: readonly number[] = [1, 2, 3];
```

Now methods like `.push()` or `.splice()` will trigger type errors.

```ts
values.push(4); // ‚ùå Error
```

You can also use:

```ts
const colors: ReadonlyArray<string> = ["red", "blue"];
```

---

## Tuples in TypeScript

Tuples are fixed-length arrays with fixed types:

```ts
let person: [string, number] = ["Alice", 30];
```

Each index has a known type. Tuples are useful when:
- The **length is known**
- The **order matters**
- Each element has a **distinct meaning**

---

## Labeled Tuples

You can label tuple elements for better clarity (editor-only feature):

```ts
type Point = [x: number, y: number];

const p: Point = [10, 20];
```

> It doesn't affect runtime, but improves readability and tooling.

## When to Use Tuples vs Arrays

| Use Case            | Recommendation      |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Homogeneous list     | Use `type[]` or `Array<type>` |
| Fixed-length record | Use `tuple`         |
| Mixed types         | Use `tuple`         |
| Immutable list      | Add `readonly`      |

---

## Summary

- Arrays hold values of the same type; tuples hold fixed, typed positions
- Use `readonly` or `ReadonlyArray<T>` to enforce immutability
- Tuples are ideal when data has a known structure with position-based meaning

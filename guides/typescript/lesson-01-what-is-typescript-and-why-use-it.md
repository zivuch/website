## What is TypeScript?

**TypeScript** is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It’s a **superset of JavaScript** that adds **static typing**, **type inference**, and **modern tooling features**.

> TypeScript code compiles down to regular JavaScript that runs in any browser or runtime like Node.js.

## TypeScript vs JavaScript

| Feature             | JavaScript        | TypeScript                       |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Typing              | Dynamic           | Static (with type inference)     |
| Compile-time checks | ❌                | ✅ Type errors caught early      |
| Tooling             | Good              | Excellent with rich IntelliSense |
| Code refactoring    | Manual            | Safe and assisted by types       |
| Learning curve      | Beginner-friendly | Steeper but scalable             |

## Benefits of Using TypeScript

### Catch Errors Early

TypeScript reports bugs **before you even run your code**.

### Self-Documenting Code

Type annotations make code easier to understand and maintain.

```ts
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}
```

### Better Tooling

Get auto-complete, jump-to-definition, and safe refactors in editors like VS Code.

### Type-Safe Collaboration

Makes large-scale collaboration across teams smoother and safer.

## When (Not) to Use TypeScript

### You should use TypeScript when:

- You’re building a **medium to large** application
- You want to **enforce contracts** in APIs and components
- You work in a **team environment**
- You want **type safety with JavaScript flexibility**

### You might avoid it if:

- You’re building a **very small script or MVP**
- Your team has **no prior TypeScript experience**
- You have **tight deadlines** and minimal type benefits

> Even in these cases, using JSDoc with `// @ts-check` can bring partial TypeScript benefits.

---

## Summary

- TypeScript adds **type safety**, **early error detection**, and **developer tooling** to JavaScript
- It compiles to standard JavaScript and integrates seamlessly with most frameworks
- Best suited for scalable applications, teams, and projects that value reliability

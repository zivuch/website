## Typing Objects with Inline Annotations

You can annotate objects directly:

```ts
const user: {
  name: string;
  age: number;
} = {
  name: "Alex",
  age: 30,
};
```

This works but becomes hard to reuse. Enter interfaces.

---

## Using Interfaces

Use `interface` to define reusable object shapes:

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const user: User = {
  name: "Lior",
  age: 28,
};
```

Interfaces help maintain consistency across components, APIs, and models.

---

## Optional and Readonly Properties

### Optional `?`

```ts
interface Product {
  id: number;
  description?: string;
}
```

This allows `description` to be omitted.

### Readonly

```ts
interface Config {
  readonly apiKey: string;
}
```

Trying to change `apiKey` after initialization will throw an error during development.

---

## Extending Interfaces

Interfaces can extend each other like classes:

```ts
interface Person {
  name: string;
}

interface Employee extends Person {
  role: string;
}

const e: Employee = {
  name: "Dana",
  role: "Developer",
};
```

This promotes DRY code and composability.

---

## Type Aliases vs Interfaces for Objects

You can also use `type`:

```ts
type Car = {
  brand: string;
  year: number;
};
```

> Prefer `interface` when defining object shapes.  
> Prefer `type` when composing unions, primitives, functions, etc.

Interfaces can be merged (declaration merging), while types are static.

---

## Summary

- Use `interface` to define structured and reusable object types
- Use `?` for optional and `readonly` to prevent mutation
- Extend interfaces to create hierarchical data models
- Know when to use `type` vs `interface` â€” both are powerful tools

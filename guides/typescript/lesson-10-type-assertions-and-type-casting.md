## What is Type Assertion?

Type assertion tells TypeScript:

> ‚ÄúI know better than you what this type really is.‚Äù

It‚Äôs used when you **want to override** the compiler‚Äôs inferred type.

---

## Using `as` Syntax

The most common form:

```ts
const input = document.getElementById("username") as HTMLInputElement;

console.log(input.value); // Type-safe access to .value
```

You can also use the older angle-bracket syntax:

```ts
const el = <HTMLDivElement>document.querySelector(".box");
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid angle brackets in JSX/React files ‚Äî it conflicts with syntax.

---

## When to Use Type Assertions

Use assertions when:
- Working with **DOM elements**
- Receiving **external data** (e.g., from `JSON.parse`)
- You **know more** than TypeScript‚Äôs inference engine

Example:

```ts
const data = '{"name":"Lior"}';
const user = JSON.parse(data) as { name: string };
```

---

## Non-null Assertion (`!`)

If you're sure a value isn't `null` or `undefined`:

```ts
const btn = document.querySelector("button")!;
btn.click();
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Dangerous if the element is not guaranteed to exist.

---

## Forced Casting with `unknown`

If a value is `unknown`, you must assert it:

```ts
const val: unknown = "hello";
const len = (val as string).length;
```

For multiple steps, cast through `unknown`:

```ts
const user = "admin" as unknown as boolean;
```

> This is sometimes useful ‚Äî but also a red flag. Use with care.

---

## Avoiding Type Assertion Abuse

Don't use assertions to **silence errors**:

```ts
// üö´ Don't do this:
const num = "123" as unknown as number;
```

Use **type guards**, **refinements**, or **safeParse** methods instead.

---

## Summary

- Type assertions override TypeScript‚Äôs inference when you‚Äôre sure of the type
- Use `as` syntax for DOM, JSON, or dynamic content
- Be cautious with `!` and double-casting ‚Äî they skip safety
- Use assertions sparingly and intentionally

## What is TypeScript?

**TypeScript** is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions. It‚Äôs open source and developed by Microsoft.

In short: TypeScript = JavaScript + Types.

This means any valid JavaScript is also valid TypeScript.

```ts
// JavaScript (valid in TypeScript)
const greeting = "Hello world!";
```

You can optionally add types:

```ts
// TypeScript
const greeting: string = "Hello world!";
```

## How is TypeScript Different from JavaScript?

| Feature        | JavaScript  | TypeScript                         |
| -------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Type system    | Dynamic     | Static + Optional                  |
| Compilation    | Interpreted | Compiled to JS                     |
| IDE support    | Basic       | Rich (intellisense, auto-complete) |
| Error catching | Runtime     | Compile-time                       |

TypeScript catches bugs before you run the code. This saves time and increases confidence in large codebases.

## Why Developers Use TypeScript

* üö´ Fewer bugs: catches mistakes at compile time
* üß† Better autocomplete and intellisense in editors
* ‚úÖ Safer refactoring and easier onboarding
* üß± Helps build scalable and maintainable apps
* üîÅ Works seamlessly with JavaScript, Node.js, React, etc.

## Is TypeScript Worth It?

Yes ‚Äî especially for medium to large projects, team-based development, or anything that will scale.

Solo devs and small scripts can benefit too, but TypeScript does require a small learning curve and config setup.

## Installing TypeScript

To install globally:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

Check version:

```bash
tsc --version
```

You can also use it locally in a project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript
```

Then add a `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

## Summary

* TypeScript is JavaScript with optional static types
* It improves code quality and developer experience
* Widely used in modern web development (especially React, Node.js)
* Easy to install and gradually adopt in existing code

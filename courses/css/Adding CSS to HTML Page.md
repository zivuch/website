## Adding CSS to Your HTML Page

Alright, you now know what CSS is and the basic structure of CSS rules. The next logical question is: **how do we actually connect our awesome CSS styles to our HTML pages so they can work their magic?**

Think of it like this: you've designed some fantastic outfits (your CSS), but now you need to tell your HTML elements (your mannequins) to wear them. There are a few different ways to do this, each with its own pros and cons. Let's explore them!

## Getting Started: Linking CSS <a id="getting-started-linking-css"></a>

There are three main ways to add CSS to an HTML page:

1.  Using the `<link>` tag (linking to an external CSS file).
2.  Using the `<style>` tag (embedding CSS directly in the HTML).
3.  Using inline styles (applying styles directly to individual HTML elements).

Let's take a closer look at each of these methods.
